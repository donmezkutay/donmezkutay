🔭 **Education**
- ***BSc.***: Meteorological Engineering from 𝐼𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑏𝑢𝑙 𝑇𝑒𝑐ℎ𝑛𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙 𝑈𝑛𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑦 with a GPA of 3.45/4 <br>
    - ***Thesis Topic***: Assessment of Urbanization Impact On Heavy Precipitation in Istanbul, Turkey
-***𝐌𝐒𝐜***: Currently Atmospheric Sciences Student at 𝐼𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑏𝑢𝑙 𝑇𝑒𝑐ℎ𝑛𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙 𝑈𝑛𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑦 (𝐢𝐭𝐮.𝐞𝐝𝐮.𝐭𝐫)
    - ***Thesis Topic***: Climate Modelling Using COSMO (ongoing)

🌱 **𝐀𝐛𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐌𝐞**
I have been improving myself to think like an engineer and observe like an atmospheric scientist, which has led me to develop new ideas to assist Climate Science. One of those ideas was to create a website, 𝐂𝐥𝐢𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐤 (𝐜𝐥𝐢𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐤.𝐜𝐨𝐦), that reveals the climate conditions of atmospheric variables in Turkey, using comprehensive statistical and thermodynamic methods. I processed the state-of-art climate data utilizing various data types (NETCDF, HDF5, GRIB, CSV) with popular Python libraries (Xarray, Numpy, Pandas, Salem, Matplotlib) and visualized it to the end-user in very engaging ways.

I developed a Python library called 𝐕𝐢𝐬𝐣𝐨𝐛𝐬 (𝐩𝐲𝐩𝐢.𝐨𝐫𝐠/𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭/𝐯𝐢𝐬𝐣𝐨𝐛𝐬) (downloaded over 𝟏8.𝟎𝟎𝟎 times according to pepy.tech) that makes it easy for atmospheric scientists to access model and observation data (ERA5, GFS, GEFS, NAM, GHCN) without even having to download them (OpenDAP).

At the International Congress on Global Climate Change held by Çanakkale 18 Mart University in May 2021, our paper, of which I am one of the authors, won the 𝑀𝑜𝑠𝑡 𝐼𝑛𝑛𝑜𝑣𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 𝑃𝑎𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝐴𝑤𝑎𝑟𝑑.
